@par Example Description

This example is a part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to
use USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID) on the STM32F1xx devices.

This is a typical example on how to use the USB peripheral in Device mode with HID class V1.11
following the "Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) Version 1.11
Jun 27, 2001". The example is built around the USB device library and emulate the Mouse directions
using Joystick buttons mounted on the STM3210E-EVAL board.

This example supports the remote wakeup feature (the ability to bring the USB suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the Key push-button is used as the remote wakeup source.

By default, in Windows OS, the USB mouse Power Management feature is turned off. This setting
is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. To enable the Wake up from  standby
option, user has to manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, the following steps have to be followed:
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively)
 - Right click and select "Properties",
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the HID class structure size.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

"STM32Cube USB Device library".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with a STM3210E-EVAL board embedding
    a STM32F103xx device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the STM3210E-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB Type A-Male
      to A-Male'


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
